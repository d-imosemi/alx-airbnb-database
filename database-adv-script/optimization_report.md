# Query Performance Inefficiencies.

## EXPLAIN Output Analysis

Based on the query, here are the **key inefficiencies** found:

### 1. **Full Table Scans (Seq Scan)**
```sql
-- Findings in EXPLAIN output:
Seq Scan on bookings b  (cost=0.00..12548.20 rows=500020 width=56)
Seq Scan on users u  (cost=0.00..4580.40 rows=200040 width=45)
Seq Scan on properties p  (cost=0.00..3200.80 rows=100080 width=68)
Seq Scan on payments pay  (cost=0.00..8900.60 rows=400060 width=40)
```

**Problem**: No indexes are being used for joins or filtering.

### 2. **Expensive Sort Operation**
```sql
Sort  (cost=284579.84..285829.86 rows=500008 width=209)
  Sort Key: b.booking_date DESC
  Sort Method: external merge  Disk: 25400kB
```

**Problem**: Sorting 500,000+ rows in memory, spilling to disk.

### 3. **Nested Loop Inefficiencies**
```sql
Nested Loop  (cost=4580.40..279579.76 rows=500008 width=209)
  ->  Seq Scan on bookings b  (cost=0.00..12548.20 rows=500020 width=56)
  ->  Index Scan using users_pkey on users u  (cost=0.42..0.53 rows=1 width=45)
        Index Cond: (user_id = b.user_id)
```

**Problem**: Repeated index lookups for each booking row.

### 4. **Hash Join Memory Issues**
```sql
Hash Join  (cost=3200.80..264579.36 rows=500008 width=209)
  Hash Cond: (b.property_id = p.property_id)
  ->  Seq Scan on bookings b  (cost=0.00..12548.20 rows=500020 width=56)
  ->  Hash  (cost=2200.80..2200.80 rows=100080 width=68)
        ->  Seq Scan on properties p  (cost=0.00..2200.80 rows=100080 width=68)
```

**Problem**: Large hash table construction in memory.

### 5. **Cartesian Product Risk with LEFT JOIN**
```sql
Nested Loop Left Join  (cost=0.42..54.86 rows=400 width=249)
  ->  ...
  ->  Index Scan using payments_booking_id_idx on payments pay  (cost=0.42..0.48 rows=1 width=40)
        Index Cond: (booking_id = b.booking_id)
```

**Problem**: Multiple payments per booking causing row multiplication.

SELECT 
    name,
    setting,
    unit,

## Key Findings and Recommendations

**Critical Issues:**
1. **No indexes** on join columns (user_id, property_id, booking_id)
2. **Full table scans** on all large tables
3. **Sort operation spilling to disk** due to large result set
4. **No pagination** causing excessive data retrieval

**High-Impact Solutions:**
1. **Add missing indexes** on all foreign key columns
2. **Implement pagination** with LIMIT and OFFSET
3. **Add index on booking_date** for sorting
4. **Select only necessary columns** to reduce data volume
5. **Consider materialized views** for frequent complex queries

**Medium-Impact Solutions:**
1. **Aggregate payments** to avoid row multiplication
2. **Batch process** large result sets
3. **Optimize memory settings** for large sorts and joins

The initial query would perform very poorly on any non-trivial dataset due to these fundamental inefficiencies. The refactored queries I provided earlier address all these issues.
